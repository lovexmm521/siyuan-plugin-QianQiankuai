# QianQian Block (Custom Block CSS + JS)

This is a powerful plugin for SiYuan Note that allows you to inject custom CSS styles, JavaScript scripts, and the new **real-time HTML block editing** feature into any content block through simple block attributes or a convenient menu.

Whether you want to fine-tune the style of a block, add unique interactive features, or directly modify the structure of an HTML block, "QianQian Block" makes it easy.

## üíó Release Notes

**v1.0.6 adds the real-time HTML block editing feature. (Note: Please avoid rapid consecutive key presses. If a block is accidentally deleted, use Ctrl+Z to restore it.)**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time HTML Block Editing**: Click directly into any HTML block to start editing its content live. It's a true WYSIWYG experience with features like automatic cursor restoration, focus lock, and rapid input protection to ensure stability.
- **Convenient Menu Editor**: Click the block icon to the left of any block to directly find and use the "Custom Block CSS" and "Custom Block JS" options in the context menu for real-time editing, saying goodbye to the cumbersome attribute panel workflow.
- **Custom Block CSS**: Beautify your notes in real-time by adding a `css` attribute to a block and writing CSS rules directly.
- **Custom Block JS**: Inject JavaScript code into blocks via the `js` attribute to implement dynamic interactions, data processing, and other advanced features.
- **Smart Toggles**: Independent master switches for Custom Block CSS, JS, and Real-time HTML Editing functionalities are provided in the top bar for easy management.
- **Real-time Application**  **&amp;**  **Cleanup**: Both CSS and JS are applied in real-time as you modify them. The plugin automatically cleans up injected styles and scripts when you clear the code or turn off the master switch, ensuring no side effects.
- **Advanced JS Cleanup Mechanism**: For complex JS operations (like adding event listeners or timers), you can `return` a cleanup function to define the script's behavior upon termination, ensuring robustness.

## üöÄ How to Use

The recommended way to use this plugin is through the block context menu:

1. Click the block icon (e.g., the `¬∂` icon for a paragraph) to the left of the block you want to modify.
2. In the pop-up menu, select **Plugin** -\>  **"Custom Block CSS"**  or  **"Custom Block JS"** .
3. Write your code directly in the editor that appears. Your code is saved automatically and takes effect in real-time.

Alternatively, you can still use the traditional block attribute method. The effect is the same.

### Custom CSS Example

Change the text color to red and add a left border.

- **Attribute Name**: `css`
- **Attribute Value**: `color: red; border-left: 3px solid blue;`

### Custom JS Example

Log the block's ID to the console when it's clicked.

- **Attribute Name**: `js`
- **Attribute Value**: `this.addEventListener('click', () => { console.log(this.getAttribute('data-node-id')); });`

**Advanced Usage:**  For JS that requires cleanup (like `addEventListener` or `setInterval`), you can return a function to perform the cleanup.

- **Attribute Value**:

  ```
  const handleClick = () => console.log('Block was clicked');
  this.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

  // Return a cleanup function
  return () => {
    this.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
    console.log('Event listener removed');
  };

  ```
